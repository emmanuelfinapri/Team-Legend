# Description of application:
Our project is an application-based to-do listâ€”a tool designed for task management and organisation. It functions as a list of tasks or activities that individuals need to accomplish, typically within a specific period.
This web-based to-do list application aims to help users organise tasks and manage their daily activities efficiently.
