# Description of application:
Our project is an application-based to-do listâ€”a tool designed for task management and organisation. It functions as a list of tasks or activities that individuals need to accomplish, typically within a specific period.
This web-based to-do list application aims to help users organise tasks and manage their daily activities efficiently.
# Product goal
By the end of this school semester, users will be able to use our To-do-list application to create daily/weekly tasks for their day to day life. Users will be able to add items/tasks to their to-do-list to ensure they are on track to their daily goals.
# Sprint goal:
The goal of this sprint was to create a working application that would enable the user to create an account with a high end/ more difficult password to keep their account safe. While in their account they will be able to create specialised lists for their day to day life while also being able to view their information or reset their passwords.
# What we have completed.
* Design & logo (done):
Our goal for the design/logo portion of the project was to give the users a welcoming experience when they opened our application and provide them with a familiar logo which could distinguish us from similar products. The logo and background were created in deliverable 1 but not implemented till deliverable 2. This is considered done as it was implemented.

* User setting Information (done):
Our goal for this function was to create a section on our application which shows the user their information from their name to email. This portion was implemented successfully which makes us consider this as done.

* Reset Password (done):
Our goal for this function was to enable the users to be able to reset their password. Assuming there was a breach or they just wanted to change it. This function is considered done because the user is able to reset their password.

* Password verification (done):
Our goal for this function was to ensure that users create reasonable passwords that will be harder to guess by someone else. This ensures increased password protection for the user. This product is considered done as it asks users to input a password with some constraints.


# Is our sprint considered done?
No, our sprint is not considered done. Out of the seven different items including the ones from the last deliverable we were to accomplish, two of them were not. We were able to deliver a working to-do-list but we could not deliver everything we said we were going to do.The users were supposed to be able to create a specialised list which was the main goal of this deliverable but we were not able to accomplish that. Which makes our sprint goal incomplete.
