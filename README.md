# Description of application:
Our project is an application-based to-do listâ€”a tool designed for task management and organisation. It functions as a list of tasks or activities that individuals need to accomplish, typically within a specific period.
This web-based to-do list application aims to help users organise tasks and manage their daily activities efficiently.

# Product goal
By the end of this school semester, users will be able to use our To-do-list application to create daily/weekly tasks for their day to day life. Users will be able to add items/tasks to their to-do-list to ensure they are on track to their daily goals.

# Sprint goal:
The goal of this sprint was to create a working application that would enable the user to add items to their to-do-list account and delete them when they were completed.

# What we have completed.
* Sign in sign out:
Our goal for this was to create a working sign in function for users.
At the end of this sprint the developper tested this function by creating an account and was successfully able to log in / logout of the to do list. During testing account creation was possible.

* Account creation:
Our goal for this sprint was to be able to create a working user account which they could log in & out of. After Further testing following the checklist below we concluded that this sprint is completed.
Logging into an account was possible with a username
Logging out of an account was possible
Meets standard required by the project owner

* Add item/delete function:
Our goal for the add item function was to enable the user to be able to add and delete items on their to-do-list which was achieved. Users are able to add items and delete them. They could also mark them as completed. Since it meets the required constraints this function is considered done.

* Validation of account creation:
Our goal for the account creation function was to send an email to the user to notify them that an account has been created. This will also enable us to send them notifications through email to notify them of when they had an incomplete task. This task was not implemented in deliverable so unfortunately it is not considered done.

* Design/logo:
Our goal for the design/logo portion of the project was to give the users a welcoming experience when they opened our application and provide them with a familiar logo which could distinguish us from similar products. The logo was created but not implemented and we just have a basic background so this deliverable is not considered done because we did not achieve our goal.


# Is our sprint considered done?
No, our sprint is not considered done. Out of the five different items we were to accomplish, one of them was not. We were able to deliver a working to-do-list but we could not deliver everything we said we were going to do. The users were to be introduced to a quality logo along with a nice and attractive background but we could not deliver. Which makes our sprint goal incomplete.
